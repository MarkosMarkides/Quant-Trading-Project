 Project Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model for trading the EUR/USD currency pair using machine learning techniques. The workflow includes:
	•	Data Acquisition: Fetching historical price data via the OANDA API.
	•	Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw data into meaningful features.
	•	Feature Engineering: Creating technical indicators to enhance model performance.
	•	Labeling: Assigning target labels based on trading strategies.
	•	Model Training: Developing a machine learning model to predict future price movements.
	•	Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters using advanced search techniques.
	•	Backtesting: Simulating trades based on model predictions to evaluate performance.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
	•	Python 3.8+
	•	Jupyter Notebook
	•	Git
